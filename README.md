# macro_puzzles
## A collection of **"puzzles"** in macroeconomics

This repository collects puzzling evidence and open questions in macroeconomic research. It aims to be a compilation of the contradictions between economic theory and the empirical evidence. Hopefully it will help us all (and motivated junior researchers) to focus on the important questions and the big picture. As such it has some similarity to the list of [Hilbert's Problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_problems).

Definition of a **puzzle** in this context:
> A puzzle is a contradiction between theoretical conjectures and empirical evidence

You are much invited to add puzzles. This list is thought to be constructive and *not* intended to be a one-sided critique on macroeconomics/DSGE models/rational Expectations/parapsychic mind control as a whole. Please be neutral and concise. The [issues](https://github.com/gboehl/pynare/issues) can be used for discussion. To **contribute**, [just edit](https://github.com/gboehl/macro_puzzles/blob/master/how-to-contribute.md) this file or [shoot me an email](http://gregorboehl.com/#cta). 


## A non-exhaustive list

### Monetary Economics
* **The Declining Natural Rate Puzzle**: The natural rate of interest seems to be steadily declining for at least the last two decades. *(Laubach and Williams, 2016, Business Economics)*
* **The Forward Guidance Puzzle**: An expected monetary policy shock in the far future has the same impact as the same shock in the current period. *(Del Negro, Giannoni and Patterson, 2015, FED NY Working Paper)*
* **The Flat Phillips Curve**: Estimates of the coefficient of the NK-PC and regression coefficients of inflation on unemployment are very close to zero. *(e.g. Ball and Mazumder, 2011, NBER Working Paper)*
* **The Monetary Transmission Puzzle**: Intertemporal substitution is a too simplistic view on the monetary transmission mechanism. *(e.g. Jappelli and Pistaferri, 2010, Annual Review of Economics)*
* **The Inflation Persistence Puzzle**: Staggered nominal contracts generate price persistence, but fail to account for inflation persistence. *(Fuhrer and Moore, QJE, 1995)*
* **The Liquidity Puzzle**: The  failure of identified monetary policy disturbances to create negative short-run correlations between nominal interest rates and the money stock. *(Mishkin, JoF, 1981)*

### Inequality
* **The Rising Markup Puzzle**: Markups on marginal costs and hence the profit share is increasing. *(e.g. Hall, 2018 NBER Working Paper)*
* **The Fast-Transition Puzzle**: Current models do not do well in explaining the rapid rise in wealth concentration since the 1980s. *(Gabaix, Lions and Moll, 2016, Econometrica)*
* **The Falling Labor Share Puzzle**: While classically assumed to be constant, the labor share is falling since the 1980s. *(Karabarbounis and Neiman, 2014, QJE)*

### Macrofinance
* **The Credit Spread Puzzle**: Structural models of default calibrated to historical default rates, recovery rates, and Sharpe ratios  typically generate Baaâ€“Aaa credit spreads that are significantly below historical values. *(Chen, Collin-Dufresne, and Goldstein, 2009, RFS)*
* **The Bond Premium Puzzle**: Macro models cannot explain the large and variable premium on long-term vs short-term bonds. *(Rudebush and Swanson, 2008, JME)*
* **The International Diversification Puzzle**: Although international financial markets are highly integrated across the more well-developed countries, investors nevertheless hold portfolios that consist nearly exclusively of domestic assets. *(Baxter and Jermann, 1997, AER)*
* **The Price Puzzle**: In many studies, the Fed Fund rate is positively correlated with inflation. *(Bernanke and Blinder, 1992, AER)*
* **The Risk-Free Rate Puzzle**: Why is the risk-free rate so low if agents are so averse to intertemporal substitution? -- Related to the Equity Premium Puzzle above. *(Weil, 1989, JME)*
* **The Equity Premium Puzzle**: Macro models require an implausibly high degree of risk aversion to explain the premium of stocks over "safe" bonds. *(Mehra and Prescott, 1985, JME)*
* **The Equity Volatility Puzzle**: Why is the volatility of stock returns so high (in relation to the short-term real interest rate)? *(Campbell, 2003, The American Economist; Shiller, 1981, AER)*

### Misc
* **The Rational Expectations Puzzle**: Survey evidence contradicts the rational expectations hypothesis. *(Greenwood and Shleifer, 2014, ReStud)*
* **The Shimer Puzzle**: Basic search-and-matching models cannot explain the volatility in unemployment given the observed volatilty in labor productivity. *(Shimer, 2005, AER)*
