How to Contribute
=================

Contributing is very simple, all you need is an account with github. Many economics already have one, if not it this is done less than a minute (and of course for free). Once you logged in, select the file you want to edit (for example the `list itself <https://github.com/gboehl/macro_puzzles/blob/master/README.md>`_\ ), and click the small edit button (the pen). Once you are done adding or editing, just click the green 'propose file change' button at the bottom. 

Contributing to the list: guideline
-----------------------------------

For the `list itself <https://github.com/gboehl/macro_puzzles/blob/master/README.md>`_\ , please keep it short and precise. Each *puzzle* entry should follow the following structure:


* **The Name-of-puzzle Puzzle**\ : Short explanation of puzzle. *(citation where puzzle is first mentioned as 'authors', 'year', 'journal')*
  Within each category, puzzles are in reversed chronological order.

Once you are done, be very welcome to add yourself to the `list of contributors <https://macro-puzzles.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributors.html>`_\ !
