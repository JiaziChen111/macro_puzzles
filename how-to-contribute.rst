How to Contribute
=================

Contributing is very simple, all you need is an account with github. Many economics already have one, if not it this is done less than a minute. Once you logged in, select the file you want to edit (for example the `list itself <https://github.com/gboehl/macro_puzzles/blob/master/README.md>`_\ ), and click the small edit button (the pen). Once you are done adding or editing, just click the green 'propose file change' button at the bottom.

contributing to the list: guideline
-----------------------------------

For the `list itself <https://github.com/gboehl/macro_puzzles/blob/master/README.md>`_\ , please keep it short and precise. Each *puzzle* entry should follow the following structure:


* **The Name-of-puzzle Puzzle**\ : Short explanation of puzzle. *(citation where puzzle is first mentioned as 'authors', 'year', 'journal')*
  Within each cathegory, puzzles are in reversed chronological order.

contributing to the detailed descriptions: guidelines
-----------------------------------------------------

If you want, you can add details like literature or links to potential solutions in a separate file. You are free to add such description if you would like to get into detail. This is the place to give in-debth explanation of each puzzle in the list and discuss potential solutions from the literature. 

For each puzzle, please roughly stick to a structure similar to:


#. Detailed description of the puzzle
#. Briefly reference were the puzzle was encountered (literatur)
#. Discuss resolutions from the literatur. Please do not discuss your opinion unless you published it somewhere as this is not meant to be a discussion forum.

Once you are done, don't forget to add yourself to the `list of contributors <https://macro-puzzles.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributors.html>`_\ !
