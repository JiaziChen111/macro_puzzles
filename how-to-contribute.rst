How to Contribute
=================

Contributing is simple, all you need is an account with github. In case you don't have one yet, you can open it in less than a minute (and of course for free). When logged in, select the file you want to edit and click the edit button (the pen). Hit the `propose file change` button at the bottom once you are finished.

If you are an experienced Github user, you can also just fork this repo and submit a pull request (PR) with proposed additions. Please keep one puzzle per per pull request.


Guideline
-----------------------------------

Let's keep each entry in the `list <https://github.com/gboehl/macro_puzzles/blob/master/README.md>`_\  short and precise.

Use the following structure:

* **The Name-of-puzzle Puzzle**\ : Short explanation of puzzle. *(citation where puzzle is first mentioned as 'authors', 'year', 'journal')*

In each category, most recent puzzles are listed first.
