How to Contribute
=================

Contributing is very simple, all you need is an account with github. In case you don't have one yet, you can open it in less than a minute (and of course for free). When logged in, select the file you want to edit (for example the `list <https://github.com/gboehl/macro_puzzles/blob/master/README.md>`_\ ), and click the small edit button (the pen). Just click the green 'propose file change' button at the bottom when you are finished.

Guideline
-----------------------------------

Let's keep each entry in the `list <https://github.com/gboehl/macro_puzzles/blob/master/README.md>`_\  short and precise.

Use the following structure:

* **The Name-of-puzzle Puzzle**\ : Short explanation of puzzle. *(citation where puzzle is first mentioned as 'authors', 'year', 'journal')*

In each category, most recent puzzles are listed first.
