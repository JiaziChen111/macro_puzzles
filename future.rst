Optionally: contributing a detailed description
-----------------------------------------------------------------

If you really (really) want, you can add details like literature or links to potential solutions in a separate file. Feel free to add such description if you would like to get into detail. This is the place to give in-depth explanation of each puzzle in the list and discuss potential solutions from the literature. 

For each puzzle, please roughly stick to a structure similar to:

#. Detailed description of the puzzle
#. Briefly reference were the puzzle was encountered (literature)
#. Discuss resolutions from the literature. Please do not discuss your opinion unless you published it somewhere as this is not meant to be a discussion forum. 
#. IF you want to discuss ideas, the _`issues tab <https://github.com/gboehl/macro_puzzles/issues> might be a good place to do so

Once you are done, be very welcome to add yourself to the `list of contributors <https://macro-puzzles.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributors.html>`_\ !
